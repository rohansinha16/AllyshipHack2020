DESCRIPTION
Based on your background, you might not be able to understand this project.


Did we get your attention? This is a microaggression, and this happens to many groups of people who are perceived to be different. Whether it's race, gender, orientation, ethnicity, skin tone, disability, or anything else, microaggressions are found everywhere in the workplace, on the internet, and in face to face interactions. How many are happening virtually now?


People desire to be better allies with minorities and a variety of affiliations. This game is designed to help them identify appropriate reactions when confronted with these scenarios. The game guides the player through uncomfortable conversations at the workplace, and presents them with a choice of responses. The goal is to enable them to learn and engage in a safe space, so they truly understand what constitutes a micro-aggression.


We believe that it would also help allies better understand the plight of these groups, so they could better support them and have the confidence to stand up against these microaggressions.

The challenge
People want to be allies but they are not sure what the right words to say are- acceptable words have changed over time. 
There is a lot of misunderstanding on why some words and phrases that seem neutral an appropriate to say to certain groups of people that are microaggressions to others (e.g. calling a black man a boy or referring to someone’s hair do as urban). 
D&I training could be improved to by letting people engage and interact in real-life situations rather than watching a video and learning about frameworks.
The Purpose

The purpose of this project is to identify the core issues that are faced in the workplace relating to diversity, inclusion and allyship. It presents an engaging and immersive experience for users to learn in a safe environment. With real time reporting incorporated into each situation, the user can build upon previous training concepts and apply them in real life. It will empower all employees to create a more inclusive work environment.

HOW IT WILL WORK / HOW IT WILL BE BUILT
Micro-Manager: A game on Microaggressions 
Players are placed in simulated work environment that combines real life situations and gamification to immerse the employee in learning concepts and identifying actions that result in negative or positive experiences for their colleagues in the workplace.

The player would choose a persona, role (e.g. manager, team member) in at the start of the simulation factoring (including gender, race, ethnicity, orientation, religion, etc.)
Depending on persona selected, player will be assigned progress bars on different metrics with base values e.g., time to complete tasks, social capital with the team…
Each character in the game will also have progress bars on different metrics: speed at completing tasks (dependent on emotions/morale)
An instruction card pops up at the beginning of the game explaining the task ahead for the player.
For example:

New Hire: Congratulations! It is your first day at Contoso and your team is excited to meet you …… you are on a 6 month probation and your task is to ensure that all your manager approves you for confirmation as a FTE
Manager: Contoso just won a huge project and you have been task with delivering it with the following metrics: - metric 1, metric 2….  Threshold of team members mood bars to remain on the team.
 Short description of the scenario (e.g. you get into the in the elevator…

5. The player will be given options to have conversations or take action with characters in the game, based on interactions, metric bars will be adjusted. Options for conversations will infused with real-life examples of microaggressions faced in the work place

6. The impact of choices within each situation is told by a narrative from a real person or through an information card/email sent to within the game.
7. The user is provided with information entailing response training related to context and taught how to react appropriately. Instead of explaining situations people can experience them and relate their actions to them and develop empathy for their co-workers.



Source of real-life data of conversations in the game

Micro-aggression survey across Microsoft

Code is pretty rough and needs cleanup and documentation.
